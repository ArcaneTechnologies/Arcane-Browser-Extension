# Arcane Extension Wallet
In its wish to spread the ability to participate in an economy that respects consumer privacy, ARCANE TECHNOLOGIESâ„¢ consciously aims to develop for as many platforms as possible. Our official wallet software is therefore ported also as an extesion for 4 major browsers, to date:

1) Mozilla Firefox
2) Google Chrome
3) Brave Browser
4) Tor Browser

This is the codebase which represents the core-software that comprises a demo 4-currency wallet, featuring Bitcoin(BTC), Bitcoin Cash(BCH), Ethereum(ETH) and Monero(XMR), indicating a proof-of-concept product for our multicurrency cryptowallet to be released soon. The different manifest.json files included can be used respectively to import the extension in Chrome (& Brave)/Firefox (& Tor), for development or testing purposes, in adherence with the spirit of open-source programming.
